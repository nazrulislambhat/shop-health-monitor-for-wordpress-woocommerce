== Description ==

A lightweight yet powerful WooCommerce monitoring plugin that continuously checks your store’s product visibility and cache health.  
If your shop suddenly displays **zero products**, this plugin can instantly:

⚠ Send *Failure Alerts* (Email + optional Slack)  
⚡ Auto-Flush Cache (LiteSpeed, WP Rocket, W3TC, Autoptimize, WP Super Cache)  
🧠 Immediately Recheck the Store  
✅ Send *Instant Recovery Alerts* if products return  
📊 Log incident history (failures, recoveries, cache flushes)  
🛠 Add a dedicated WooCommerce Health widget in Dashboard  

Perfect for preventing the infamous “blank shop / no products” issue caused by cache corruption or host-side glitches.
