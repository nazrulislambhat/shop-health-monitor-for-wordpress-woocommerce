## 📌 Overview

**Shop Health Monitor for WooCommerce** is a lightweight but powerful monitoring tool designed to prevent the “0 products showing” / “blank shop” issue often caused by cache corruption or WooCommerce query failures.

The plugin continuously monitors your WooCommerce storefront, alerts you instantly when products disappear, automatically flushes LiteSpeed Cache, and even performs an **immediate recovery check** to verify if the problem resolves instantly.

Perfect for WooCommerce stores hosted on **LiteSpeed**, **Hostinger**, or any setup where product visibility issues occur.

### 🔁 Immediate Post-Purge Recovery Check

After purging cache, the plugin waits ~5 seconds and checks again:

- If not → waits for next scheduled check
